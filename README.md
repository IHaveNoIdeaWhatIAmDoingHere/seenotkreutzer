HI, welcome to my litle game
you are the Captain (Vormann) of a rescue cruiser, you have to patrol the area and find people floating in the sea or their life rafts. 
You can use your binoculars (b) to track down people that need help. 
Burning ships can be extinguished by using your water canon (a). 
make sure to not colide with others vessels, as it might sink them and break your ship.... You can repair your ship and bunker new fuel at every yellow harbour crane.
You can end the game any time and save your score! To do so: you drive your ship to the hospital at any time... 
Maybe you find some hidden gems in the game as well... 

have fun...
